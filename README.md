# Iminn-Bluetooth-Presense-Sensor
Raspberry Pi based sensor to track your presense and send a URL to IFTTT, Tasker etc.

Inspired by a scene in the movie called "Anti-trust (2001)"

This Raspberry Pi Project senses a MAC address for a Bluetooth device such as a Gear S3 watch to determine when you enter and
leave a specific area aka a room.

It communications this to services like IFTTT, Join, Tasker, etc...

The result is that you have to turn on/off lights, play music, passively.

IFTTT - Is the easiest way to use it but its limited.

Tasker is the most advanced way to use it which allows you to do advanced logic.

I cover it in my YouTube channel - TheHiTechNomad
